    Rosewood Coast traces its roots back to a Presbyterian church in West Chester, OH, where guitarist Zack Sempsrott performed as a worship musician. After a short time with a rock trio, Sempsrott began jamming with a drummer named John Trygier through a mutual friend. Sempsrott invited Trygier to join a new project he was forming named Rosewood Coast, a 5-piece alternative rock act. After two years of writing and perfecting their craft, the group released two singles, Junebug and With You, followed by their first album, Wisdom in the Waves, which earned the group a nomination for both New Artist of the Year and Best Rock Act at the 2019 Cincinnati Entertainment Awards.  <br>

Following a successful album release show, creative and professional differences led to a series of breaks in the original five, leaving Sempsrott and Trygier searching for new musicians to bring into the fold. After months of searching, Trygier reached out to a former high school classmate who was studying Musical Theatre in the area, Kali Marsh. Trygier had performed with Marsh as part of their high school productions of “Guys and Dolls”, and “Mary Poppins”, with both admiring the musical abilities of the other, despite not being close friends. Trygier reached out to Marsh via an Instagram DM, and the group became a tight-knit trio of songwriters.

The group debuted their new singer with a series of performances at MOTR pub, a popular original music spot in Cincinnati, as well as an opening performance for a national act, William Ryan Key (Formerly of Yellowcard), and a landmark performance for the group at BLINK festival in Cincinnati, which drew over 2 million spectators that year. Throughout this exciting time for the band, Trygier, Sempsrott, and Marsh released a string of acoustic cover videos for their followers on Instagram, quickly developing an impressive amount of engagement with their video content on the platform, with multiple videos reaching 25,000+ views, and thousands of likes.

Following this string of performances, the group hunkered down to develop a new single, searching to refine and expand on the sound of the first album. In December of 2019, the trio made their first trip down to Nashville, where they recorded the new song at the legendary Sound Kitchen Studios, sharing the same space as artists such as Shania Twain, 21 Pilots, Dolly Parton, and many more. This also marked the bands first foray into hiring session musicians for their music, working with some of Nashville’s top session players and producers for the song. The song will be released on all music platforms on March 6th, 2020. Follow Rosewood Coast on Instagram, Facebook, or on Spotify to get updates on their new releases!
